    "#### Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a collection of organized data that is stored and managed in a computer system. It is designed to efficiently store, retrieve, and manipulate data for various applications and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two types of databases that differ in their data model, storage approach, and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data model: SQL databases follow a fixed schema or structure where data is organized into tables with predefined columns and data types. These databases use a relational model where data is stored in tables with relationships established using keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storage approach: SQL databases use a tabular structure to store data, and data integrity is maintained through constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, and referential integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query language: SQL databases use SQL as the standard query language to perform operations such as inserting, updating, retrieving, and deleting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning they can handle increasing loads by adding more resources to a single server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases: SQL databases are suitable for applications that require complex transactions, high data integrity, and structured data, such as financial systems, e-commerce platforms, and content management systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data model: NoSQL databases do not follow a fixed schema and can handle unstructured or semi-structured data, such as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or time-series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storage approach: NoSQL databases use various storage approaches, such as document-based, column-based, key-value, or graph-based, to store data flexibly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query language: NoSQL databases do not necessarily use SQL as the query language. Some NoSQL databases may have their own query languages or APIs for data retrieval and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, meaning they can handle increasing loads by adding more servers to a distributed system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases: NoSQL databases are suitable for applications that require flexible and scalable data storage, such as big data analytics, real-time streaming, and handling high-velocity data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases are well-suited for applications that require structured data and complex transactions, while NoSQL databases are suitable for handling unstructured or semi-structured data and providing scalable storage solutions.\n"

    "### Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to define and manage the structure of a database. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create a new database object such as a table, view, or index. For example, to create a table named \"customers\" with columns for customer ID, name, and email in an SQL database\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP: The DROP statement is used to delete an existing database object. \n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object.\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all data from a table but retain the structure of the table. It is often used to quickly delete all data from a table without deleting the table itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, DDL statements such as CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used in SQL databases to define, modify, and delete the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and schemas. They are essential for managing the schema and structure of a database and ensuring data integrity and consistency.\n",

    "DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, and it is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to manipulate data in a relational database. DML consists of three main operations: INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, which are used to add, modify, or remove data in database tables, respectively. Here's an explanation of each operation with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT: The INSERT statement is used to add new rows or records into a database table. \n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE: The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing rows or records in a database table.\n",

    "DQL stands for Data Query Language, and it is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used for retrieving data from a database. DQL includes the SELECT statement, which allows you to query and retrieve data from one or more tables in a database.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Primary Key and Foreign Key are important concepts in relational databases that are used to establish relationships between tables and ensure data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. It must have a unique value for each row, and it cannot contain null values. A primary key is used to uniquely identify a record in a table, and it is used as a reference point for other tables to establish relationships. Every table should have a primary key to ensure the uniqueness and integrity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables based on the values of these columns. The table that contains the foreign key is called the referencing table or child table, and the table to which the foreign key refers is called the referenced table or parent table. The foreign key is used to maintain referential integrity, which ensures that data in the child table corresponds to the data in the parent table."

    "\n",
    "The order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query generally follows the sequence below:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT: This clause is used to specify the columns or expressions that you want to retrieve from the database. It is typically the first clause in an SQL query and determines the data that will be retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM: This clause specifies the table or tables from which you want to retrieve data. It is typically used immediately after the SELECT clause to specify the source of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "JOIN: This clause is used to combine data from multiple tables based on a specified condition. It typically comes after the FROM clause if any table joins are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "WHERE: This clause is used to filter the rows retrieved from the table based on a specified condition. It typically comes after the FROM and JOIN clauses and before the GROUP BY clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "GROUP BY: This clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns. It typically comes after the WHERE clause and before the HAVING clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAVING: This clause is used to filter the groups of rows retrieved from the GROUP BY clause based on a specified condition. It typically comes after the GROUP BY clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORDER BY: This clause is used to sort the rows retrieved from the table based on specified column(s) in ascending or descending order. It typically comes after the WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "LIMIT/OFFSET: These clauses are used to limit the number of rows retrieved from the table or skip a certain number of rows. They typically come at the end of the query after all other clauses."
